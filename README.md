# Macros used to compile `parol`'s generated code

The macros provided by this crate are used to compile code generated by the
*[parol](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol)* parser generator.

You have to reference this crate only if you use `parol` in auto-generation mode where it creates
an adapter grammar that uses macros provided by this create.
